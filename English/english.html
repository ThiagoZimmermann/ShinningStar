<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
We are a <strong>tech-driven platform</strong> designed to connect service providers with clients through an independent, 
personalized and secure environment. Our goal is to make human connection more meaningful, respectful and versatile — 
while ensuring freedom of choice and diversity are at the core of the experience.
</p>

<h1>Mission, Vision & Values</h1>

<p>
Our mission is to restore and enhance interpersonal relationships — emotional or intimate — 
in a world shaped by fast, superficial connections.  
</p>

<p>
Our vision is based on three pillars: <strong>security</strong>, <strong>practicality</strong> and <strong>trust</strong>.  
</p>

<p>
Our core values include: diversity, consent, constant vigilance, sexual freedom, customer control, privacy, 
mutual respect, and personal satisfaction.
</p>

<h1>Product & Functionality</h1>

<p>
Our product is a <strong>digital platform</strong> for promoting independent services. Providers can define their own services — 
from companionship to emotional support — and customize their public profile. Clients can browse, select, and connect 
based on their own preferences.
</p>

<p>
Key features include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personalized profiles for both providers and clients</li>
  <li>Smart recommendation system</li>
  <li>“Tinder-style” swipe interface</li>
  <li>Stories (called “Moments”) and post features</li>
  <li>Preference-based matching (region, identity, interests)</li>
</ul>

<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>
Users and providers create accounts by verifying identity and filling out preferences.  
The platform connects both sides only when there is compatibility. Providers can change their services or target audience anytime.  
Clients can use the “Surprise Me” button to explore more diverse providers, helping to reduce bias and objectification.
</p>

<h1>Plans & Subscriptions</h1>

<p>
We offer multiple subscription levels for both clients and providers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Normal</strong>: free, limited chats and requests</li>
  <li><strong>Bronze</strong>: extended chats, scheduling tools, phenotypic filters</li>
  <li><strong>Silver</strong>: more requests, regional expansion, better visibility</li>
  <li><strong>Gold</strong>: unlimited features, price filters, private photos, promotional perks</li>
</ul>

<h1>Evaluation System</h1>

<p>
Both clients and providers are rated after each service. Ratings include quality, respect, punctuality, and behavior.  
Profiles show average stars and service history. Disrespectful comments can be reported and filtered, especially in Silver and Gold plans.
</p>

<h1>Marketing & Social Media</h1>

<p>
We target a young adult audience (18–30), focusing on digital presence.  
We work with influencers, adult content creators and models to promote visibility.  
Our channels include Instagram, X (Twitter), YouTube, TikTok and podcasts.  
Special promotions and seasonal campaigns are launched throughout the year.
</p>

<h1>Merchandising</h1>

<p>
Gold members may receive monthly branded products such as sex toys, clothing, and accessories.  
Official merchandise is also available for purchase through our website.
</p>

<h1>Security & Privacy</h1>

<p>
Security is a top priority. We protect users and providers through:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strict account verification (ID photo, age check, IP limitation)</li>
  <li>Two-factor authentication</li>
  <li>Emergency Button to alert police and send location instantly</li>
  <li>Permanent ban for crimes, prejudice or abuse</li>
  <li>Advanced encryption (AES-256), digital identifiers and firewalls</li>
  <li>No screenshot allowed on sensitive content</li>
  <li>Right to delete account and remove all stored data</li>
</ul>

<h1>Provider Care</h1>

<p>
We treat providers as care professionals.  
We offer resources such as self-care reminders, psychological and medical support suggestions, and tools for emotional health and work balance.
</p>

<h1>Target Audience</h1>

<p>
Our platform is designed for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clients</strong> looking for personal connection, intimacy or companionship, regardless of price.</li>
  <li><strong>Providers</strong> seeking visibility, professional tools, premium benefits and a respectful work environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We believe in building respectful, empowering and safe connections — putting <strong>people, choice, and dignity first</strong>.
